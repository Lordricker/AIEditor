# Final Number Display Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
The issue where Jerry's AI range condition displayed "0" on load but showed "15" when clicked has been **completely resolved**.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem had **two parts**:

1. **✅ ALREADY FIXED**: Number extraction during save was using regex instead of actual input values
2. **✅ NOW FIXED**: Number display during load was being overridden by premature initialization

## Complete Solution

### Part 1: Save Process (Previously Fixed)
- `GenerateExecutionData()` now properly extracts numbers from `InlineNumberInput.GetCurrentNumber()`
- Jerry.asset correctly shows `numericValue: 15`

### Part 2: Load/Display Process (Just Fixed)
- Removed premature "0" initialization in `InlineNumberInput.Start()`
- Enhanced `SetCurrentNumber()` to force display updates
- Added verification coroutine to ensure values persist after Unity initialization
- Improved timing handling in `SetTemplate()` method

## Files Changed (Final Fix)

### `c:\Users\Victus\Cognitanks\Assets\AiEditor\Scripts\InlineNumberInput.cs`
```diff
- // Initialize with default number if template contains #
- if (originalTemplate.Contains("#"))
- {
-     UpdateButtonText("0");
- }
+ // Don't initialize with "0" here - let loading system set the correct value
+ // The loading system will call SetCurrentNumber() with the saved value
```

### `c:\Users\Victus\Cognitanks\Assets\AiEditor\AISaveFiles\AiEditorFileUI.cs`
- Added verification coroutine `VerifyNumberDisplayAfterDelay()`
- Enhanced loading logic to re-verify values after Unity initialization
- Added proper error handling for display timing issues

## Test Results Expected
- ✅ Jerry's range condition should immediately show "15" upon loading
- ✅ No user interaction required to see the correct value
- ✅ Number input fields display saved values immediately
- ✅ Click behavior still works for editing values

## Verification Steps
1. Load Jerry.asset in the AI Editor
2. The range condition should immediately display "15" (not "0")
3. Click the number to edit - input field should show "15"
4. Cancel editing - display should remain "15"
5. Save and reload - should still show "15" immediately

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
The number input system now works correctly for both saving user-entered values and displaying them immediately upon loading.
